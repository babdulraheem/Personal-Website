            <br>

            <p id="story">I am Bashar Abdulraheem, an Iraqi citizen and a student at Tacoma Community College. I was an ambitious high school graduate that loved to be unique in everything I did. I didn’t like to live life the way my friends desired, because their
                life path was predictable. They were going to graduate from high school and attend one of the colleges or universities in Baghdad, then graduate, get married and live all their life in Iraq. But being unique after graduating from high
                school was not a simple process because I had to think about a way to leave my country and live in Europe or the United States. That way was to work as a translator for the American forces in Iraq in order to get a visa to gain a permanent
                residency status in the United States. I faced numerous gaps working as a translator for the American Armed Forces in Iraq and those were religious, cultural, and linguistic, and many others which I had to deal with on daily basis. One
                of the most important gaps I faced was a religious gap. For example, my job demanded literal translation of every discussion or conversation between Iraqis and Americans. I wanted to ask the Imam (the leader of prayers in a mosque), who
                is supposed to have a well-rounded knowledge about Islam and Sharia (the Islamic law), about my job to recognize whether it is halaal (allowed) or haram (forbidden). He answered quickly and clearly before giving me the chance to explain
                the desire for working in such field of work. He said, “It is haram and you are helping the invaders to kill your Muslim brothers and God will never forgive such sin and you will go to hell and stay there forever!” The way he said those
                words made me feel like I killed Jesus (peace be upon him). The Imam’s words shocked me, but I remember that, one day, my grandmother told me that God judges people on what they intend to do and not on what they do. To illustrate, if I
                worked with the American Armed Forces in the intention to help them kill Muslims I would get severely punished by God, but if I worked with the Armed Forces in the intention of helping to bridge the gap between Americans and my Muslim
                brothers in order to help Muslims from getting arrested or getting killed by mistake, and to help myself to leave my country in order to have better education and a better life, I would be greatly rewarded by God in this life and the next
                life. The second gap was cultural, for example the way people treat each other in Arabic countries. If an individual does not like a certain person the individual would not be forward and say, “I don’t like you.” Instead Arabs try to avoid
                this way of communication and the reason for that is to be respectful. But what Arabs do is to imply that they dislike the other person in kind words and non-violent language, and the other person’s responsibility is to understand and
                respect the other individual. While the American style is totally forward, I am not saying it is specifically wrong. There are advantages and disadvantages to it when dealing with Arabs. An advantage is that it is going to prevent problems
                that might happen due to the dislike of one person to another. A disadvantage is that it hurts people emotionally. We are humans. We have emotions and feelings. We are vulnerable and we get hurt emotionally but we pretend that we did not
                get hurt in order not to show weakness. A third gap was the food Muslims eat. I am a Muslim which means that I can eat any vegetables, fruits and anything that is made from plants. But there are restrictions on the meat Muslims eat. Muslims
                cannot eat pork. Eating pork is strongly haram (forbidden), and who eats it will be considered as an infidel (a person that does not believe in the oneness of God) and infidels will burn in hell for eternity. And Muslims cannot eat any
                meat that is not halal (not allowed) whether it was beef or lamb. The way to make it halal is to say “in the name of God” before slaughtering the cow or the sheep and give time for the blood to drain. The fourth gap was emotional. I felt
                I was an outcast. Iraqis thought I was a traitor. They analyzed it that way because I was wearing the American combat uniform with full armor and a M4A1 carbine assault rifle in my hand and wearing the American flag on my left shoulder.
                Iraqis did not know the reason behind wearing the American flag. They judged me without hesitation. The reason was to protect interpreters from being detected by snipers. Because if snipers see a member with a different uniform or sign
                they would detect and shoot that individual down. Translators wore the American flag not because they hate Iraqis and love Americans but because it is a way to protect their life and the mission. Americans did not trust me at all. They
                thought that I was a spy. It made sense to them because my father was a general in the Iraqi army, I was too young to learn to speak English fluently and fast and my family heritage is Samarie (which descends from Salad Din province which
                most Iraqi leaders came from). So it was an obvious suspicion and I had to go through a long and hard investigation process that took a month. Those were the gaps that I had to fill with patience, honesty, integrity, and hard work. I learned
                a lot and I hope that Americans would start to be more familiar with Islam and Muslim culture to bridge the gaps between our worlds.
